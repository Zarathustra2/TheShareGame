    <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the
      extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website,
      including its contents, and the services offered there.</p>
    <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation
      (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of
      operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation,
      alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or
      otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction
      performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
    <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope,
      purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own
      control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party
      components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in
      said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
    <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
    <p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data
      subjects<br>III. Information about the data processing</p>

    </p>
    <p>The controller's data protection officer is:</p>
    <p><span class="text-primary">Dario Heinisch</span></p>

    <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
    <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data
      subjects have the right</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the
        data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and
        copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
      </li>
      <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
      <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or,
        alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to
        restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
      </li>
      <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same
        transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
      </li>
      <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning
        them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also
        Art. 77 GDPR).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of
      any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17
      Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible
      or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about
      these recipients.</p>
    <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the
      controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In
      particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is
      permissible.</strong></p>
    <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
    <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose
      for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any
      statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

    <h4>Server data</h4>
    <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our
      server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These
      server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website
      from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of
      your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
    <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of
      your data.</p>
    <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in
      the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
    <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required
      for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from
      deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
    <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies
      stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information
      about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for
      example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart
      function.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies
      are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
    <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest
      lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1
      lit. f) GDPR.</p>
    <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
    <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
    <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the
      purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
    <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and
      purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
    <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
    <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can
      use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and
      measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please
      use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for
      support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you
      will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this
      also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help
      function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for
      support.</p>
    <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site
      may be fully usable.</p>

    <h4>Customer account/registration</h4>
    <p>If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use the data you entered
      during registration (e.g. your name, your address, or your email address) exclusively for
      services leading up to your potential placement of an order or entering some other contractual
      relationship with us, to fulfill such orders or contracts, and to provide customer care (e.g.
      to provide you with an overview of your previous orders or to be able to offer you a wishlist
      function). We also store your IP address and the date and time of your registration. This data
      will not be transferred to third parties.</p>
    <p>During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this processing of your
      data, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us will be used
      exclusively to provide your customer account.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis
      for this processing.</p>
    <p>If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the initiation of a
      contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an existing contract with us, the legal basis
      for this processing is also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
    <p>You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at any time under
      Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking
      your consent.</p>
    <p>The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is no longer
      necessary. However, we must observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial
      law.</p>

    <h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
    <p>We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and ratings on our
      website, hereinafter referred to jointly as "posts." If you make use of this opportunity, we
      will process and publish your post, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you
      may have used.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent
      under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are
      revoking your consent.</p>
    <p>In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is
      processed because we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action
      if your post infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
    <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in
      any legal defense we may have to mount.</p>

    <p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your
      visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored
      there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby
      Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the
      US.</p>
    <p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of
      visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide
      other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.</p>
    <p>Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google
      provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at</p>

    <p>in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular
      browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our
      website. The add-on informs Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the
      website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent
      information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as
      detailed herein.</p>
